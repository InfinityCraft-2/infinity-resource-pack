# Infinity Resource Pack

This is currently a work in progress resource pack for our server. If you would like to use it, be sure
to check out the license.

You can download it under the [WIP Release](https://github.com/InfinityCraft-2/infinity-resource-pack/releases/tag/wip) in releases. If you use the zip download URL for a server, it will automatically be updated as we
updated the pack on GitHub. Otherwise, check back every once in a while to download it.
